# ðŸŒŒ Deciphiring the Cosmos: ML for Exoplanetary Analysis

The Kepler Space Telescopeâ€™s mission has provided a wealth of data in the form of Kepler Objects of
Interest (KOI), presenting unique challenges and opportunities for astronomical data analysis. This study
utilises two distinct machine learning techniques to enhance the understanding and classification of
exoplanets. Firstly, a t-SNE visualisation incorporating several exoplanet statistics is employed to explore the underlying data structure and visualise the complex relationships within the high-dimensional space of Kepler observations. Secondly, a Random Forest classifier is built to independently predict the disposition of KOIs based on their physical and orbital characteristics.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kepler Exoplanet Search Results (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results/data)
- The dataset includes over 10,000 KOIs with properties like planetary radius, orbital period, equilibrium temperature, and classification status.

## Techniques Used
- **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- **Random Forest** for supervised classification
- Data preprocessing: missing value handling, feature scaling
- Data visualtion: Initial data exploration
